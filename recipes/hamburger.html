    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A hamburger, or simply burger, is a food consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground
         meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. 
         Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, 
         or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a 
         "special sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently 
         placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger patty topped with cheese is called a 
         cheeseburger.

        The term burger can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, 
        especially in the United Kingdom, where the term patty is rarely used, 
        or the term can even refer simply to ground beef. Since the term hamburger 
        usually implies beef, for clarity burger may be prefixed with the type of meat 
        or meat substitute used, as in beef burger, turkey burger, bison burger, 
        portobello burger, or veggie burger. In Australia and New Zealand, a piece of 
        chicken breast on a bun is known as a chicken burger, which would generally not 
        be considered to be a burger in the United States; Americans would generally call 
        it a chicken sandwich, but in Australian English and New Zealand English a sandwich 
        requires sliced bread (not a bun), so it would not be considered a sandwich.
